### Summary of Code Changes on TicTacToe.py

1. **Better Structured code** Functions and key actions on the code are now commented as suggested by the PEP8 standard and also the structure of the code follows that standard
2. **Change the size and color of the "X" and "O" symbols and center them** Where now the colors of the "X" symbol is red and the color for the "O" symbol is blue. Also make bigger the symbols and center them according to the board.
3. **Check whether a square is already occupied** Where now, if the square is occupied, neither of both players can place any of their symbols on that square.
4. **Determine when the game is over and indicate who won or if there was a tie** Where the terminal now shows who the winner of the match is. Unfortunately, and due to an error unknown to me, the game doesn't stop when it should, so the board fills up, leaving the matches tied.
